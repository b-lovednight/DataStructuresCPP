# DataStructuresCPP
Project repository for CS300 

This program's purpose was to parse a .csv file, input class information into a Course variables, and place variables in a vector data structure.  Once in a data structure, variables can be sorted, displayed, and searched through user input. 

The problem was first examined from the data set given in the project.  Since it was a small data set, a vector data structure was decided for it's speed and coding simplicity. 

Much testing was required during the parsing and structure loading phase.  After sufficiently trying multiple column headers, the .csv file was being correctly read.  The actual data structure algorithms were easier to code.
